**The Ayodhya Ram Mandir, also known as the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, is a Hindu temple located in the city of Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is dedicated to Lord Rama, a prominent deity in Hinduism, and is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama.**

## **Background**

**The history of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir is deeply intertwined with the socio-political landscape of India. The site has been a focal point of religious and political disputes for centuries. In 1992, the Babri Masjid, a mosque built in the 16th century by the Mughal emperor Babur, which stood at the site, was demolished by a political rally. This event led to widespread communal riots and legal battles over the ownership of the land.**

## **Construction**

**After decades of legal proceedings, the Supreme Court of India ruled in November 2019 that the land should be handed over to a trust to facilitate the construction of a Hindu temple. The construction of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir began in August 2020, following a groundbreaking ceremony attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other dignitaries.**
